# Jupyter Notebook for the evaluation of new Semantic Similarity Measures

In this section you will find a Jupyter Notebook for the evaluation of semantic similarity measures. 

**In this notebook, [Python 3](https://www.python.org), [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) as well as the Python libraries Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and SciPy are used.**

You should have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) installed in your computer, which already installs Python 3, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and SciPy. 

If you have any issues, the library versions used in the development of this notebook can be found in the table below.

| Library     | Version  |
|:-----------:|:--------:|
| Anaconda    | 5.3.0    |
| Matplotlib  | 3.0.3    |
| Numpy       | 1.15.4   | 
| Pandas      | 0.23.4   | 
| Scikit-learn| 0.20.1   |
| Scipy       | 1.1.0    |

Other necessay .py modules can be found in this folder. The benchmark data sets are available [here](https://github.com/liseda-lab/kgsim-benchmark/tree/master/Data%20Sets). Additionally, a HTML file with an example of a possible output is also available.
